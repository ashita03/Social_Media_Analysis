# Social Media Analysis: Exploring Students' Weekly Usage

## About the Data
The dataset contains data obtained from students regarding their weekly usage of social media. Subsequently, the data has been consolidated into a single row through averaging. It includes multiple other target features such as mood productivity, whether or not a student had trouble falling asleep, tired waking up in the morning, and the energy level throughout the week.

## Methodology
The approach employed for this analysis involves the following steps:

* `Principal Component Analysis` - Used to explore the potential reduction of dimensions by determining the optimal number of Principal Components (PCs).
* `Clustering` - Utilized to identify patterns within the data by grouping similar data points.
* `Factor Analysis` - Employed to identify underlying factors that can group various columns.
* `Multiple Regression and Logisitic Regression` - Resorted to Regression to predict whether students' face trouble sleeping based on social media usage.
* `Linear Discriminant Analysis` - Applied LDA to create a model to predict whether students' face trouble sleeping or not and the correlation of the same to their social media usage
